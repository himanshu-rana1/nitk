            <br>
            <p>In this context, NITK Surathkal has started a research study to predict the growth of the cases in India using Machine Learning.
               We are using Recurrent Neural Networks to build a Deep Learning Model and answer many questions that can help the administration
               make important decisions that can save lives. A group of Volunteers consisting of Alumni, Faculty and students of NITK are
               working tirelessly on this project under the supervision of Dr. Alwyn Roshan Pais, HOD, CSE Department, NITK Surathkal.
